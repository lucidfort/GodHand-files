Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

## Horizontal Rule

Sometimes you will want to have a horizontal rule. So, the syntax for that is write your first text(s) then give a line space(this isn't really necessary but the editor could mistake it for bold), then add three or more asterixs or dashes or underscores (anyone that is more convenient for you), give another line space and finally continue writing.

**_For Example:_**

First Text

---

Second Text

---

Third Text

---

**Note:** Using dashes will also make the text above it bold and larger. Use only if you want that feature.
