# MARKDOWN TUTORIAL

## Heading

The amount of hasttags determines the heading you are applying. One means h1, two means h2 and so on.

## Text Decoration

You could use asterix or underscore interchangeably

**bold**

_italicize_

**_bold and italicize_**

## Some Extended Versions of Markdown

## HTML Codes

You can wrap a single line of text in a backtick to make it a code. You can also write multiple lines of code if you use the triple backtick

```ts
const a: string = "Amaka";
const b: number = 6;
const c: string = a + b;
```

`let name = "Amanda"`

Remember this is among the extended specification. The normal default mode to write code is through indentation...ie. Give a lot of space(one tab hit is enough)

    const a = 'string'

## Links

The text of the link should enter into the square brackets while the url goes into the curved brackets

[This is a link](https://google.com)

## Images

Images have the exact same format as links but you have to place an exclamation mark before the brackets. The text inside the square brackets is the normal html alt text while the curved bracket contains the link to your image

  alt="It's me again"
/>

## Block Quotes

You can cite someone or yourself by placing an angle bracket first then your quote next. You can also next quotes by using two or more angle brackets.

> Nyansh na nyansh by Chella
>
> > Hello Brother by Omah Lay
> >
> > > The list continues

**Note:** If you are nesting you dont need the extra line to make the next quote move down. It does that automatically. But you will still that line space if you are not nesting.

## Horizontal Rule

Sometimes you will want to have a horizontal rule. So, the syntax for that is write your first text(s) then give a line space(this isn't really necessary but the editor could mistake it for bold), then add three or more asterixs or dashes or underscores (anyone that is more convenient for you), give another line space and finally continue writing.

**_For Example:_**

First Text

---

Second Text

---

Third Text

---

**Note:** Using dashes will also make the text above it bold and larger. Use only if you want that feature.

## List

Just type a number followed by a period, then a space and finally the list item. It doesn't matter if you repeat numbers or skip the normal flow. Just have a number there.

1. Eat Rice
2. Buy chocolate
3. Go shopping
4. Do you get it now?

You can also make unordered lists. Instead of the numbers, we will have either an asterix or a dash or a plus symbol

- Eat Rice

* Buy Chocolate

- Go shopping

You can also nest lists inside lists. Just add 4 whitespaces or a single tab click and you can now start a new list

1. One
   - Eat Rice
1. Two
   - Buy Chocolate
   * Go shopping
1. Three
   - Do you understand it?
     1. Yes
     1. No

## Tables

This below is the syntax for writing tables. In addition for alignment, adding a colon beside those dashes signifies which alignment you want. Placing it to the left of the dash means left alignment, right means right alignment and both sides means center alignment

| Igbo       |    English | Status |
| :--------- | ---------: | :----: |
| Iruka      | Fortunatus |  Nil   |
| Chinwe     |   Cordelia |  Yeah  |
| Chiemerie  |     Tekina |  Yeah  |
| Onyeka     | Fortunatus |  Yeah  |
| Akachukwu  |   Kingsley |  Yeah  |
| Kenechukwu |  Epiphanus |  Yeah  |
| Chinaza    |  Mary-Elma |  Yeah  |

## Check List or Task List

That is a dash, a space, a square bracket, a space inbetween the brackets for an unchecked list but an x(whether in lower or uppercase) for a checked list, followed by another space and finally your task.

**_Understood?_**

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No
